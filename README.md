# Debug MCP Server in VSCode

This repo showcases sample MCP server and debugging in VSCode.

The sample MCP server is the same as [MCP Quick Start](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/quickstart-resources/), in Python / TypeScript.

When debugging, it launches [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/) that you can easily test those tools in browser.
